				<h2><strong>RULES / REGULATION</strong></h2>
<p>If you have been in contact with or visited someone with COVID-19, you should quarantine yourself for at least 14 days, even if you do not have symptoms. COVID-19 can still spread even if you do not have symptoms.</p>
<p>CDC has the legal authority to detain any person who may have an infectious disease that is specified by Executive Order to be quarantinable. If necessary, CDC can deny ill persons with these diseases entry to the United States. CDC also can have them admitted to a hospital or confined to a home for a certain amount of time to prevent the spread of disease.</p>

These stations and their respective jurisdictions are as follows: Anchorage: Alaska. Honolulu: Hawaii and Guam. Seattle: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. San Francisco: Northern California and Wyoming. Los Angeles: Southern California (with the exception of San Diego), Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. San Diego: Southern California/Mexico border region and Arizona. El Paso: New Mexico and West Texas. Houston: East Texas and Louisiana. Dallas: North Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Minneapolis: Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska. Chicago: Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana. Detroit: Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky. Atlanta: Georgia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina. Miami: Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. San Juan: Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. Washington, DC: Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. Philadelphia: Delaware and Pennsylvania. Newark: New Jersey. New York: New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. Boston: New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine." width="665" height="486" /></p>

<p>This map shows the location of several CDC quarantine stations and the jurisdiction of each of them. They are located at border points where many international travelers arrive. These stations decide if people are well enough to enter the US. The CDC can quarantine people if it deems it necessary to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<p>*I don't think that the quarantine stations are too important in terms of COVID for residents and citizens, mainly for travelers.</p>
<h2><strong>Temporary Rule</strong></h2>
<p>Paid Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act</p>
<p>On April 1, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor announced new action regarding how American workers and employers will benefit from the protections and relief offered by the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act and Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act, both part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The Department&rsquo;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) posted a temporary rule issuing regulations pursuant to this new law, effective April 1, 2020. For more information, see <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/ffcra">www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/ffcra</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FFCRA will help the United States combat and defeat COVID-19 by reimbursing American private employers that have fewer than 500 employees with tax credits for the cost of providing employees with paid leave taken for specified reasons related to COVID-19. The legislation will ensure that workers are not forced to choose between their paychecks and the public health measures needed to combat the virus, while at the same time reimbursing businesses.</p>
