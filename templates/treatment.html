							<h2><strong>VACCINE(S)</strong></h2>
<p>There are currently over 50 different covid vaccines in testing by the World Health Organization to determine whether or not they are safe and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are currently only <strong>2</strong> vaccines that are authorized by the WHO:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html">Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html">Moderna&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These two vaccines have undergone and succeeded in WHO testing, and are therefore safe to be administered by health officials.</p>
<p>How It Works:</p>
<p>Covid is an mRNA virus, meaning that a normal vaccine won&rsquo;t work for it. Because of the pandemic, much research has been put into finding ways to protect people from mRNA viruses, and it appears that we have finally found a solution. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>A regular vaccine simply introduces a weakened version of the pathogen into your bloodstream, allowing your body&rsquo;s immune system to recognize it and develop ways to take it down before a real infection ever occurs. However, with mRNA viruses, you cannot do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the COVID vaccine takes the mRNA of the virus, the material that codes for it. This mRNA is injected into the bloodstream, where a cell or cells will begin to use the instructions to form a copy of the protein piece that would normally surround a COVID-19 virus. The immune system sees this protein piece and realizes that this protein does not belong there, and begins an immune response by creating antibodies, like what would happen in a normal infection, in order to take it out. The immune system then remembers the proteins of the shell and is now able to identify and destroy any future infections.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: The vaccine gives part of a blueprint for a &lsquo;car&rsquo; to your cells, who build that part. The cells end up building enough of the car that it can be recognized, but not enough for it to work (say, they do not include an engine or extra blueprints).</p>
